## 🔧 PRD Gaps & Improvements Needed

### 🚨 High Priority Tasks

#### Original PRD Syntax Requirements

  - ✅ Consistent with PRD specification

#### Dependencies Alignment
- [x] **Add missing dependencies from PRD**
  - ✅ Created fallback implementation without external dependencies
  - ✅ Added chalk-like color functionality using ANSI codes
